# VT-IAST
Variable Temperature Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory

The Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) is a thermodynamic framework used to predict multi-component adsorption behavior based on single-component adsorption data at a specific temperature. IAST is versatile and applicable under varying conditions and variables. In this work, we introduce Variable Temperature IAST (VT-IAST), an extension of IAST that broadens its applicability by interpolating single-component adsorption isotherms across a temperature range, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. This extention allows for deeper insights into surface properties and selective adsorption in four distinct porous samples. These samples are tested using binary and ternary mixtures of \(CO_2\), \(N_2\), and \(O_2\), at pressures up to 10 bar and temperatures between 283 K to 313 K. VT-IAST proves to be both robust and efficient for material screening and system optimization, and is designed to integrate smoothly with commercial gas adsorption instrument software. This integration enables researchers to explore a wider range of conditions and materials, potentially accelerating the discovery of advanced adsorbents with superior performance.
